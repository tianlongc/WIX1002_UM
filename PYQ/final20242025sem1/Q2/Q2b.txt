2b) i. The execution of the given program below uses nested if-else statements to control the flow of execution based on the values of x, y and z. The program starts by checking if x > y is true or not. If yes, it will check for y > z and it is false, so it move to the else block. Inside the else block, it checks if x < z but it is false, so it moves to the final else block. After that, the final else block outputs "Condition 3".

2b) ii. The output of the following program when it runs is "Condition 3". This is because the conditions x > y is true and y > z is false lead to the final else block where x < z is evaluated to false results in printing "Condition 3".
